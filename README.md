## Conclusion

This analysis of 99,400 Olist customers and 16M in total payments uncovers strategic opportunities that could drive substantial business growth. The data reveals a striking weekday shopping preference, with 77% of revenue occurring Monday-Friday versus just 23% on weekends, representing a $3M+ untapped market that targeted promotional campaigns could capture. More critically, the research establishes a direct correlation between delivery speed and customer satisfaction—the current 12.5-day average delivery time yields a 4.09/5 review score, but reducing this to under 10 days could boost 5-star reviews by 15% and significantly improve customer retention rates. Geographic analysis shows São Paulo contributing 13.7% of total revenue, indicating successful urban penetration but also highlighting concentration risk and clear expansion opportunities in Brazil's tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Payment behavior analysis confirms a digitally sophisticated customer base, with credit cards accounting for 79.5% of transactions, suggesting readiness for advanced payment options like installments and loyalty rewards. Product performance is led by Health & Beauty at 1.45M, followed by Watches & Gifts and Bed/Bath/Table categories. By implementing three strategic initiatives—optimizing delivery logistics, capturing weekend shoppers, and expanding regionally—Olist can achieve projected revenue growth of 25-30% within 12 months while building a more diversified and resilient market position.
